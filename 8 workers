Path A — keep one port, maximize stability with Uvicorn workers=8

What to change in your run_uvicorn.ps1:

Pin latest Uvicorn & pure-Python protocol on Windows

Force the Windows-friendly stack explicitly (avoids C extensions/edge cases):

add --loop asyncio

add --http h11

Keep --ws auto (default) or omit entirely.

Tweak queueing & rotation

Add --backlog 512 (Windows is less happy with very large backlogs).

Add --limit-max-requests 5000 (recycle workers to avoid long-lived quirks).

Keep --limit-concurrency 500 (good backpressure).

Actually set 8 workers

Pass -Workers 8 (and remove 6 from the .bat so they don’t disagree).

Strongly recommended before you run:

Upgrade runtime once in your venv:

pip install -U "uvicorn[standard]" h11
